Giallo Basic example
===============

To compile this example you need rebar in your PATH.

Type the following command:
```
$ rebar get-deps compile
```

You can then start the Erlang node with the following command:
```
./start.sh
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8080. You will then see the
static handler serving CSS and Images and a echo handler that echoes
Query or Post parameters.
